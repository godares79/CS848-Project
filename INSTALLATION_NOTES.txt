On Java:

Want to install Oracle Java 1.7.0_09.
Follow info on www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux.
Don't bother with JRE, JDK has everything.
Seems to all work without issue.


On YCSB:

Need to install maven2.
cd to directory of YCSB-master.
run 'mvn clean package'.
May get an error about asm-3.1.jar being invalid, and causing build to fail.
Download asm-3.1.jar off the internet and replace in ~/.m2/....
Should be about to complete build process at that point.

Need to create a properties file for cassandra that lists the hosts and threadcount.
Must create keyspace called usertable and a column family called data in cassandra.
Can use command: bin/ycsb shell cassandra-10 -P properties to play around

Use workloadb on cassandra, it's the heavy read load.
Already uses a zipfian distribution.
To run the load use: bin/ycsb load cassandra-10 -P workloads/workloadb -P properties -s > load.log
To run the actual reads/writes: bin/ycsb run cassandra-10 -P workloads/workloadb -P properties -s > run.log
Redirect stdout to a logging file (i.e., command > output.log), use -s with command to print status info to stderr


On Cassandra:

Using latest version of cassandra for now at least...
Latest version of cassandra requires at least java 1.7.
OpenJDK should be alright, as long as not attempting to rebuild from source. Oracle JDK can recompile from source (installed oracle jdk on the cluster machines).
Make sure to create the /var/log/cassandra and /var/lib/cassandra directories and change their ownership.
bin/cassandra -f and bin/cassandra-cli -host localhost for running cassandra.
Ran the simple tutorial in the README.txt file in Cassandra.

Try using cqlsh insteade of cassandra-cli. cqlsh is a SQL wrapper around cassandra, it is much nicer to use.


On setting up Cassandra on multiple nodes:

The first node setup is more complex than the rest of the nodes.
Need to change the conf/cassandra.yaml file.
 - May need to change the partitioner entry, but it is random for now.
 - Change the listen_address and rpc_address to the node address. Also change the seed to the node address.
 - The request_scheduler entry in this file sounds exactly like what we are interested in implementing. We should look at this further, but it looks like org.apache.cassandra.scheduler.{NoScheduler,RoundRobinScheduler} is exactly where we should be implementing our scheduling algorithms.
 - Used the tutorial at wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MultinodeCluster

Cassandra is set up on all nodes. Seems to all be working.
