On YCSB:

Need to install maven2.
cd to directory of YCSB-master.
run 'mvn clean package'.
May get an error about asm-3.1.jar being invalid, and causing build to fail.
Download asm-3.1.jar off the internet and replace in ~/.m2/....
Should be about to complete build process at that point.
Need to create a properties file for cassandra that lists the hosts and threadcount.
To run the load use: bin/ycsb load cassandra-10 -P workloads/workloada -P properties
To run the actual reads/writes: bin/ycsb run cassandra-10 -P workloads/workloada -P properties

On Cassandra:

Using latest version of cassandra for now at least...
Latest version of cassandra requires at least java 1.7.
OpenJDK should be alright, as long as not attempting to rebuild from source.
bin/cassandra -f and bin/cassandra-cli -host localhost for running cassandra.
Ran the simple tutorial in the README.txt file in Cassandra.
