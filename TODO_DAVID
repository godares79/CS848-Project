Cassandra:
 Figure out the consistency level that we should use (should we use do quorum reads and writes?)
 Assign tokens to nodes (see the cassandra wiki getting started, set initial_token in cassandra.yaml)
  Keep using RandomPartitioner, it is just hash partitioning
 Get Cassandra source code, make sure it can compile and work
  Cassandra is compiling in Windows - instructions: http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/RunningCassandraInEclipse
  Use latest version of Eclipse
  Fairly straightforward, no problems getting it running
 Install and compile the Cassandra command line client
 Look into the scheduling algorithms code
 
YCSB:
 See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties, figure out exact settings
 Load up a database on the cluster with data, try something like 10,000,000 records to start with
 Section 6 of https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload is useful when it comes to threads and deadlines
 
Experiments:
 Get a baseline using NoScheduler and RoundRobinScheduler
 Make extensive notes on setting used for experiments
