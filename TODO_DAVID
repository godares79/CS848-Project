Cassandra:
 Figure out the consistency level that we should use (should we use do quorum reads and writes?)
 Figure out the partitioning scheme (Random is probably best)
 Assign tokens to nodes (see the cassandra wiki getting started, set initial_token in cassandra.yaml)
 Get Cassandra source code, make sure it can compile and work
 Look into the scheduling algorithms code
 
YCSB:
 See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties, figure out exact settings
 Load up a database on the cluster with data, try something like 10,000,000 records to start with
 Section 6 of https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload is useful when it comes to threads and deadlines
 
Experiments:
 Get a baseline using NoScheduler and RoundRobinScheduler
 Make extensive notes on setting used for experiments
