This will serve as a place to record some notes and ideas for the course
paper as they are thought of…

- Single evaluation section, separate subsections for simulation and 
  physical server evaluation
- Really need to justify why we check what resource information we do
  in order to gather the server load
- Zipfian distribution for data load curve
