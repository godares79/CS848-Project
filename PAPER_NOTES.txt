This will serve as a place to record some notes and ideas for the course
paper as they are thought of…

- Single evaluation section, separate subsections for simulation and 
  physical server evaluation
- Really need to justify why we check what resource information we do
  in order to gather the server load
- Zipfian distribution for data load curve

- Compare our scheduler, to the current cassandra method of sending
a read request to all replicas and then using the first returned one
   Our will hopefully be better
